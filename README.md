MCP2515 Library for Arduino
==============
MCP2515 library v1.1
This library is compatible with any shield or CAN interface that uses the MCP2515 CAN protocol controller.
Baudrates 5k, 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k, 125k, 250k, 500k, & 1000k are confirmed to work using a Peak-System PCAN-USB dongle as a reference.

Installation
==============
Copy this into your "[...]/MySketches/libraries/" folder and restart the Arduino editor.

NOTE: If you have an older version of the library (CAN_BUS_Shield) be sure to remove
 it from the libraries folder or replace the files with those in this library to avoid conflicts.


*Happy Coding!*
